## üìù DETAILED TESTING NOTES

### Data Fields to Verify in Mobile App:
- **StoreDetails:** Store name, address, phone, logo image, cover image
- **BankDetails:** Payment method (GCash/PayMaya/Bank), account name, account number
- **DocumentUpload:** Business Permit, Valid ID (base64 converted)
- **Personal Info:** Owner name, email (from registration)

### Data Fields to Verify in Web Admin:
- **Business Owner Info:** Real name/email (not "Maynard Dotarot")
- **Business Address:** Real store address + city (not "63 Jacinto Street")
- **Business Description:** Real description (not Lorem ipsum)
- **Documents:** Your actual uploaded files with working "View" links
- **Status Badge:** Yellow "Pending" initially, changes to green "Approved"

### Firebase Data Structure Check:
```
store_registrations/{userId}:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personalInfo: { name, email, mobile }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ businessInfo: { storeName, address, city, description }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documents: { businessPermit, validId }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paymentInfo: { method, accountName, accountNumber }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status: "pending" ‚Üí "approved" ‚Üí "active"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ timestamps: { createdAt, updatedAt, approvedAt }
```

### Real-time Sync Verification:
- **Mobile listeners:** useStoreRegistration hook should detect changes
- **Web admin:** Firebase real-time database subscriptions
- **Expected delay:** 2-3 seconds maximum for status updates
- **Fallback:** Pull-to-refresh if automatic updates fail

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Registration Flow Fails:
1. **Check Firebase Config:** Verify all EXPO_PUBLIC_ environment variables
2. **Check Permissions:** File access for image/document uploads
3. **Check Network:** Stable internet connection required
4. **Check Console:** Look for JavaScript errors in React Native debugger

### If Base64 Upload Fails:
1. **Check FileSystem Import:** Should use `expo-file-system/legacy`
2. **Check File Size:** Large files may timeout
3. **Check File Format:** Ensure proper image/PDF formats
4. **Check Firebase Rules:** Upload permissions must be enabled

### If Smart Routing Fails:
1. **Check Auth State:** Firebase auth.currentUser should exist
2. **Check Registration Data:** StoreRegistrationService.getRegistrationData()
3. **Check Status Values:** Must match STORE_STATUS constants
4. **Clear App Data:** Reset and try fresh registration

### If Web Admin Shows Hardcoded Data:
1. **Check Firebase Connection:** Admin service should fetch real data
2. **Check Data Mapping:** PendingApprovalDetails component field mapping
3. **Check User ID:** Ensure correct userId parameter passed
4. **Check Console Errors:** TypeScript or Firebase query errors

### If Approval/Reject Doesn't Work:
1. **Check AdminService:** approveStoreRegistration/rejectStoreRegistration functions
2. **Check Firebase Rules:** Admin write permissions
3. **Check Status Updates:** Both store_registrations and stores collections
4. **Check Mobile Listeners:** Real-time subscriptions active
