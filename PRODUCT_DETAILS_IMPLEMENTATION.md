# Product Details Screen Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Product Details screen for the TindaGo React Native app, converted from the Figma design with pixel-perfect accuracy.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`app/(main)/product-details.tsx`** - Main product details screen
2. **`src/components/ui/StoreCard.tsx`** - Reusable store card component
3. **`src/assets/images/product-details/`** - All product detail images downloaded from Figma

### Modified Files:
1. **`app/(main)/home.tsx`** - Added navigation to product details screen
2. **`app/(main)/_layout.tsx`** - Added product-details route to tabs (hidden)
3. **`src/components/ui/index.ts`** - Exported StoreCard component

## Features Implemented

### Product Details Screen Features:
- **Product Image Gallery**: Interactive image carousel with thumbnail selection
- **Product Information**: Name, subtitle, weight, price, rating, and reviews
- **Description Section**: Expandable product description
- **Related Items**: Horizontal scroll of related products using existing ProductCard
- **Other Stores**: Vertical list of stores selling the same product
- **Quantity Selector**: Add/subtract quantity controls
- **Add to Cart Button**: Primary action button with cart icon
- **Navigation**: Back button and notification button in header

### Design Compliance:
- **Pixel-perfect positioning** using exact Figma coordinates with responsive scaling
- **Proper responsive scaling** using `s()`, `vs()` functions throughout
- **Color consistency** using established TindaGo color palette
- **Typography consistency** using Clash Grotesk Variable font family
- **Shadow effects** matching Figma design specifications

### Components Used:
- **ProductCard** - Reused existing component for related items
- **StoreCard** - New component for store listings
- **Responsive scaling** - All dimensions use baseline scaling system

### Navigation Flow:
```
Home Screen → Product Card Tap → Product Details Screen
```

## Technical Implementation

### Responsive System:
- Base dimensions: 440x956 (Figma frame size)
- Scaling functions: `s()` for width, `vs()` for height
- All coordinates converted from Figma with exact positioning

### State Management:
- `quantity` - Product quantity selector
- `selectedImageIndex` - Active image in carousel

### Assets:
All images downloaded from Figma and organized in:
```
src/assets/images/product-details/
├── product-image-1.png
├── product-image-2.png  
├── product-image-3.png
├── notification-icon.png
├── chevron-left.png
├── star-icon.png
├── cart-icon.png
├── plus-icon.png
├── minus-icon.png
├── store-profile.png
└── store-bg-image.png
```

## Usage

### Navigation:
- From home screen, tap any product card to navigate to product details
- Use back button to return to home screen

### Interaction:
- Tap thumbnail images to change main product image
- Use +/- buttons to adjust quantity
- Tap "Add to cart" to add product to cart (currently logs to console)
- Tap store cards to view store details (currently logs to console)

## Code Quality

### Best Practices:
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Proper error handling for image loading
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular component structure
- Reusable styling patterns

### Performance:
- Optimized image loading with proper resizeMode
- Efficient ScrollView implementations
- Proper TouchableOpacity feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production:
1. Add product data from API/database
2. Implement cart functionality with state management
3. Add product variants (size, color, etc.)
4. Implement store navigation
5. Add wishlist functionality
6. Add product reviews and ratings
7. Implement search and filtering
8. Add product comparison features

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Pixel-perfect design matching Figma
- ✅ Responsive scaling on different screen sizes
- ✅ Navigation flow from home to product details
- ✅ Interactive elements (quantity, image selection)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ Component reusability and modularity

## Conclusion

The Product Details screen has been successfully implemented following TindaGo's established patterns and design system. The screen provides a complete product viewing experience with proper navigation, interactivity, and responsive design that matches the Figma specification exactly.
