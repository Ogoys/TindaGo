TINDA-GO: STRUCTURED CONTENT BY SECTIONS
==================================================

## INTRODUCTION
------------------------------
INTRODUCTION Project Context In the Philippines, sari-sari stores have long been the foundation of neighborhood commerce, offering accessible and affordable goods to everyday customers. These small, family-run businesses are deeply rooted in Filipino culture and are often the first choice for household needs. Despite their importance, most sari-sari stores still rely on traditional, manual methods—like handwritten inventory, verbal sales recording, and cash-based transactions. This lack of digitalization places them at a disadvantage in a rapidly modernizing and mobile-first society. As e-commerce and digital platforms rise in popularity, large retail chains and online grocery platforms continue to dominate the market by offering convenience, speed, and real-time accessibility. Unfortunately, smaller community-based stores are often excluded from this technological shift. They lack access to systems that could help streamline operations, record transactions, or even provide data insights that could improve profitability. TindaGo is a mobile-based solution specifically designed to address these gaps by empowering sari-sari store owners through technology. The application serves as a digital assistant that helps in tracking inventory, logging purchases and sales, managing returns, and recording spoilage or damaged goods. It also allows customers to browse available products and place orders for pickup, providing a structured and user-friendly shopping experience. By bringing digital tools into the hands of small store owners, TindaGo aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce losses, and create new revenue streams. The system encourages sari-sari store owners to embrace mobile technology not only for easier inventory and transaction management but also to better connect with their customers in a more modern, reliable way.


==================================================

## PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Purpose and Description The main purpose of the TindaGo project is to develop a mobile application that digitizes and enhances the daily operations of sari-sari stores. These include inventory management, sales monitoring, order processing, and transaction tracking. With the support of this platform, store owners can operate with better accuracy and insight while customers experience more organized, convenient ordering. TindaGo is not just an inventory app—it also functions as a sales and reporting system. It records detailed sales information, monitors product availability, and even keeps logs for returned, damaged, or spoiled items. This helps store owners manage their goods efficiently and identify trends that can guide future purchase decisions. One of the unique features of TindaGo is its built-in transactional revenue model. The app generates income through a small percentage fee based on each product sold via the platform. This ensures sustainability of the app while remaining affordable and fair for sari-sari store users. Unlike other platforms that focus heavily on delivery services, TindaGo is designed with a pickup-only approach to simplify logistics. Many sari-sari stores operate within walkable distance from their customers, making pickups more practical and cost-efficient. Customers will be able to see dynamic, and itemized listings With TindaGo, store owners gain real-time visibility into their operations, while customers get a reliable and user-friendly way to order essential goods. The application bridges the gap between traditional micro-retail and modern digital commerce, making everyday community shopping more efficient and future-ready.

## METHODOLOGY
------------------------------
METHODOLOGY Technical Background Overview of Current Technologies to be Used in the System The development of TindaGo: A Mobile Application for Sari-Sari Store Ordering with Inventory Management System is powered by modern technologies selected to meet the specific needs of sari-sari store operations and their local customers. The platform is designed to streamline inventory management, order processing, and sales tracking through a reliable and easy- to-use mobile interface. To begin the development process, Figma is used for designing the app’s user interface. It allows the team to collaboratively create clean, responsive layouts, ensuring the app is user-friendly and visually engaging from the start. The frontend of the app will be developed using Flutter, which will allow the team to build the app quickly using one codebase. The app will mainly work on Android devices but will be ready for other platforms in the future. For the backend, Firebase Firestore will be used as the main database, which will help with real-time updates like inventory changes and order tracking. Hive will be used to save some data like cart items and order history, even when there’s no internet. To handle logins and user accounts, Firebase Authentication will be used. Users will be able to sign in with their email, and later on, social media logins may also be added. For updates and order notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) will send push notifications directly to the users’ phones. TindaGo will earn revenue through a small percentage per product sold. For now, payments will be done in cash upon pickup, but the team plans to add digital payment options like PayMongo in the future, so users can pay with GCash, Maya, or other e-wallets.

An admin dashboard will be built using Node.js and Express.js to manage store approvals, monitor activities, and generate reports. Jest will be used for backend testing to ensure system reliability. For collaboration and version control, the team will use Git and GitHub. Development will be done using Android Studio for mobile and Visual Studio Code for backend and UI components. The development of TindaGo: A Mobile Application for Sari-Sari Store Ordering with Inventory Management System will adopt the Agile model, a methodology that supports flexibility, user involvement, and continuous improvement—ideal for building a mobile platform tailored to the daily needs of sari-sari store owners and local customers. Agile’s iterative approach allows the development team to adapt quickly to user feedback and changing requirements. The model follows six phases: Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Review, and Launch (Refer to page 27, Figure 1). The process begins with the Planning (Requirements and Analysis) phase. During this stage, the team identifies and analyzes the system’s core requirements. Key functionalities include store registration and verification, product listing and stock monitoring, sales tracking, customer order placement for in-store pickup, return goods and spoilage logging, and admin-level reporting and account management. These requirements are compiled into the product backlog, a flexible list of prioritized tasks that evolves throughout development. Inputs from user research, interviews with store owners, and analysis of local business practices ensure that the system addresses real-world needs specific to sari-sari stores. Next, in the Design phase, the team focuses on creating the system’s visual and structural framework. User interface designs are created using tools like Figma, with attention to simplicity and usability for both store owners and customers. Supporting design tools such as use case diagrams and data flow diagrams define how different modules—such as Inventory Management, Sales Tracking, Customer Orders, and Admin Controls—interact with one another. This stage helps align the technical structure of the system with user workflows and business operations.

In the Implementation phase, features from the backlog are developed during short, time-boxed sprints. The team uses technologies such as Flutter for cross-platform mobile development and Firebase for backend services. Each sprint focuses on specific modules, like inventory logs or customer order forms. Daily stand-ups help the team coordinate, address challenges, and make quick adjustments. This allows development to stay on track while remaining adaptable. The Testing phase ensures that every feature functions correctly and efficiently. The team conducts unit testing, integration testing, and user experience checks. Features like product management and sales recording are tested thoroughly to avoid system issues. Bugs and usability concerns are addressed before moving forward. This stage protects app reliability and data accuracy. After testing, the team enters the Review phase, where finished features are presented to stakeholders. Feedback is gathered to improve functionality and realign priorities. The product backlog is then updated based on this feedback. This continuous loop keeps development grounded in real-world use. It also helps the system grow with user expectations. Finally, approved features move to the Launch phase, where they are deployed for live use. Customers can place pickup orders while store owners manage products, monitor sales, and log spoilage. The team conducts a retrospective at the end of each sprint to evaluate their performance and plan improvements. This continuous improvement ensures the app evolves smoothly. Through this Agile process, TindaGo is developed to be practical, user- centered, and responsive to the unique needs of local micro-retailers. Its iterative development ensures that each version brings meaningful progress while remaining flexible to community feedback—making it an ideal solution for modernizing the sari-sari store experience without relying on delivery services.

Calendar of Activities The Gantt chart represents the summary of activities. Listed are the activities and opposite them are their duration or period of execution. The BLUE indicate the activity has started or is not yet finished, while the YELLOW indicate the task is on progress or finished (Refer to page 27, Figure 2). To begin, the developers brainstormed ideas for a feasible and relevant system. This took place in the early weeks of February and was followed by title creation and title defense to finalize the proposed system. Once approved, the data gathering stage began, where information relevant to the system was collected through interviews and document reviews. The developers then wrote the Project Context, Purpose and Description, and Objectives, which served as the foundation of the proposed system. Scope and limitations were also identified to define the project's boundaries. Revisions for the Purpose and Description, Objectives, and Scope and Limitations were completed in early April to ensure clarity and alignment with the proposal requirements. To further support the study, the Review of Related Studies/Systems was conducted to analyze existing systems and identify gaps that the project could address. This was followed by the completion of the Technical Background, and the Requirements Gathering phase, where functional and non- functional requirements were identified. After gathering, the team performed a Requirements Analysis to refine the project’s system requirements. Diagrams such as process flowcharts and use case models were created to provide a visual representation of the system operations. The next steps involved collecting and organizing necessary Resources and completing the Requirements Documentation. An Appendix was compiled to include relevant supporting materials. Finally, the Proposal Defense was scheduled in May to formally present the finalized proposal to the panel for review and approval.

==================================================

## REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------
Requirements Documentation This section outlines the initial user interface (UI) design of the TindaGo mobile app, highlighting key screens such as the login process, customer home screen, and store owner dashboard. These mockups offer a visual guide on how users will interact with the system. Each screen reflects the core features of TindaGo, from user verification to product browsing and sales monitoring. The UI emphasizes ease of use, clarity, and mobile responsiveness to ensure smooth navigation for both customers and store partners. The goal is to make daily transactions efficient and accessible. TindaGo Login Screen The login and verification process begins by prompting users to enter their mobile number for authentication. After submitting the number, users receive a one-time password (OTP) via SMS for verification. If an account already exists, users must enter their password; otherwise, they can proceed to register. The design uses soft backgrounds, large input fields, and vibrant buttons to create a welcoming and accessible layout. Options like "Resend OTP" and "Change Phone Number" are also included for user convenience. This secure multi-step process helps prevent unauthorized access while keeping the experience simple and fast (Refer to page 28, Figure 3) TindaGo Home Screen (Customer View) The customer home screen allows users to browse available grocery items from local sari-sari stores. Users can set or view their current location at the top and use the search bar to find products. The screen displays grocery items like "Piattos" in a grid format with clear images and labels, making it easy to scan and choose products. There is no delivery option shown, as TindaGo focuses on in-store pickup or reservation. The navigation bar at the bottom gives quick access to Home, Categories, Cart, and Menu. The layout is clean and user- focused, allowing for fast product selection and seamless navigation (Refer to page 28, Figure 4)

TindaGo Store Dashboard For sari-sari store owners, TindaGo provides a personalized dashboard that combines analytics with daily store operations. At the top of the dashboard is a sales tracking graph, which visualizes performance trends over time— helping store owners make data-driven decisions. Below this, the interface features clickable tiles for managing different modules: Products, Orders, Pick- up Orders, Transactions, Sales, Items, and Revenue. Each tile is clearly labeled and designed for touch interaction, ensuring ease of use on mobile devices. This layout enables store owners to monitor their business, update product availability, and analyze earnings all in one place. The dashboard is optimized for mobility, allowing operations to continue whether at home or in-store (Refer to page 29, Figure 5)


==================================================

## DESIGN
------------------------------
Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes The design phase of TindaGo was strategically planned to address the unique operational needs of sari-sari stores in the Philippines, with an emphasis on inventory tracking, sales monitoring, order processing, and customer management. The system was developed with a focus on usability, modularity, and scalability—ensuring the app supports the day-to-day needs of local store owners and customers. To visualize how information flows through the system, we created Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) for major processes. These include customer registration, store registration, order management, and admin dashboard activities. Each diagram helped map out how data moves between users, the system, and storage. For instance, store orders flow from customer input to store confirmation and system logging. These diagrams ensured process clarity and guided our backend development (Refer to pages Use Case Diagrams were also developed to outline system functions based on user roles. Identified users include customers, store owners, and admins. Each diagram illustrated typical actions such as placing orders, updating inventory, or approving registrations. This helped define the necessary features and interactions for each role. The diagrams also ensured that no key function was overlooked during planning (Refer to pages 33–35, Figures 12–18). For User Interface (UI) Design, the team used Figma to create interactive wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes. The UI emphasizes clean navigation and user- friendly workflows, especially for Android devices, which are widely used in the Philippines. Screens were designed for modules such as the store dashboard, inventory tracking, order listings, and sales history—providing sari-sari store owners with a simple but powerful tool for managing operations. In terms of system architecture, TindaGo adopts the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure modular, organized, and maintainable code. The Model layer handles all business logic and data management tasks, including product listings, user profiles, store records, inventory levels, and sales tracking. The View layer focuses on

displaying a user-friendly interface using design outputs from Figma, tailored specifically for mobile Android devices. The Controller manages user actions, links the model and view, and executes system logic such as confirming orders or updating inventory. This architectural pattern allows for scalable development and easier debugging, as each component operates independently but cooperatively. The system also applies a procedural design approach to handle sequential business processes such as store registration, product inventory updates, order confirmation, and customer feedback collection. Organized into functions and control flows, this design ensures smooth backend operations including validating store approvals, adjusting stock after each order, processing returns, and generating sales reports. This structure not only simplifies task execution but also supports clear logging and error handling in real-time. TindaGo’s database is built using Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL system that organizes data into collections and documents for real-time updates and high scalability. The design centers around key collections such as Products, Sales, Purchase History, Inventory Logs, and Damages and Spoilage, each representing a core function of sari-sari store operations. For example, the Products collection stores details like price, stock, and last restocked date, while Sales tracks transactions with items sold and total amounts. Inventory Logs and Low Stock Alerts help monitor and manage stock changes and shortages in real time. Additional collections like Return Good Stocks and Expenses ensure accurate tracking of returns and operational costs. A basic Users collection supports role-based access, allowing for secure management by cashiers or admins (Refer to page 36, Figure 19). TindaGo’s design process reflects a well-structured approach that combines technical architecture, functional modules, and user experience principles. By aligning mobile-first interface design with robust backend logic and real-time data handling, the system is both responsive and scalable—providing sari-sari store owners with a modern yet accessible tool to manage daily operations more efficiently.
