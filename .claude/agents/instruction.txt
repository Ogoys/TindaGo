I need help with this Figma design:

It's a product listing screen with:

Error Handling Example:

@tindago-design-to-code

I'm getting this error when implementing your previous solution:

ERROR: Module not found: react-native-vector-icons
at ProductListScreen.tsx:15

The screen should show product cards with heart icons for favorites.
Can you fix this and update the component?

I need:
- Email validation
- Password strength check
- Error messages below inputs
- Disable submit button until valid
