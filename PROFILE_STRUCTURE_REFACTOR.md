# Profile Structure Refactoring - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully refactored the profile architecture to create a clean, consistent, role-specific folder structure for both Customer and Store Owner profiles.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Before (Confusing Structure)
- ❌ Customer used shared placeholder: `app/(main)/shared/profile.tsx`
- ❌ Store Owner had dedicated profile folder: `app/(main)/(store-owner)/profile/`
- ❌ Inconsistent architecture between roles (file vs folder)
- ❌ Basic placeholder UI for customers (no Figma design)

### After (Clean Structure) ✅
- ✅ Customer has dedicated profile folder: `app/(main)/(customer)/profile/`
- ✅ Store Owner has dedicated profile folder: `app/(main)/(store-owner)/profile/`
- ✅ **Consistent folder-based architecture for both roles**
- ✅ Both have nested _layout.tsx for scalability
- ✅ Figma-designed UI for both roles

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Created Customer Profile Folder Structure ✅
**Files Created:**
- `app/(main)/(customer)/profile/_layout.tsx` (29 lines)
- `app/(main)/(customer)/profile/index.tsx` (133 lines)

**Old File Removed:**
- `app/(main)/(customer)/profile.tsx` (deleted)

### 2. Customer Profile Layout (`_layout.tsx`) ✅
**Features:**
- Stack navigation for nested profile routes
- Documented future sub-routes (account-settings, e-wallet, help)
- Matches Store Owner profile structure pattern
- Scalable for future feature additions

### 3. Customer Profile Index (`index.tsx`) ✅
**Features:**
- Uses `CustomerProfileScreen` component (from Figma conversion)
- Firebase Auth integration via UserContext
- Custom menu items with navigation
- Logout with confirmation dialog
- User initials from email
- Clean separation of concerns
- Updated import paths for nested folder structure

**Menu Items:**
1. My Account → `/(main)/(customer)/profile/account-settings` (future)
2. Order History → `/(main)/(customer)/orders`
3. E-Wallet Details → `/(main)/(customer)/profile/e-wallet` (future)
4. Help & Support → `/(main)/(customer)/profile/help` (future)
5. Terms & Privacy Policy → `/(main)/(customer)/profile/terms-privacy` (future)
6. Log Out → Sign out + navigate to onboarding

### 4. Updated BottomNavigation Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/ui/BottomNavigation.tsx`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Before
onPress={() => router.push("/(main)/shared/profile")}

// After
onPress={() => router.push("/(main)/(customer)/profile")}
```
Note: Navigation now points to the profile folder, which auto-routes to profile/index.tsx

### 5. Updated Customer Layout ✅
**File:** `app/(main)/(customer)/_layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated documentation to reflect nested profile folder structure
- Documents profile sub-routes (index, account-settings, e-wallet, help)
- `<Stack.Screen name="profile" />` remains the same (Expo Router auto-detects folder)

### 6. Enhanced Store Owner Profile Layout ✅
**File:** `app/(main)/(store-owner)/profile/_layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive documentation comments
- Documented all nested routes
- Already has clean structure (no code changes needed)

**Routes:**
- `index`: Main profile with settings (469 lines, Figma design)
- `store-product`: Product listing and management
- `add-product`: Add new product form

**Assets Location:** `src/assets/images/store-owner-profile/`

---

## 🧹 Architecture Benefits

### Consistency ⭐
- Both roles now have **identical folder-based structures**
- Both use nested Stack navigation via `_layout.tsx`
- Both have `index.tsx` as the main profile screen
- Both use Figma-designed components
- **No more file vs folder inconsistency!**

### Scalability ✅
Customer profile is now fully scalable, just like store owner:
  ```
  app/(main)/(customer)/profile/
  ├── _layout.tsx           ← Handles nested routing
  ├── index.tsx             ← Main profile (current)
  ├── account-settings.tsx  ← Add user settings (future)
  ├── e-wallet.tsx          ← Add wallet management (future)
  ├── help.tsx              ← Add help center (future)
  └── terms-privacy.tsx     ← Add legal pages (future)
  ```

  **Just create a new file, it automatically appears in the Stack!**

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Role-specific code in role-specific folders
- Shared components only for truly shared screens
- Well-documented layouts

### Navigation Flow
```
Customer Home (BottomNavigation)
    ↓ (tap Profile icon)
Customer Profile Screen (Figma design)
    ↓ (tap menu items)
Various sub-screens (orders, wallet, etc.)

Store Owner Home (Tab Navigation)
    ↓ (tap Profile tab)
Store Owner Profile Screen (Figma design)
    ↓ (tap settings)
Profile sub-screens (store product, add product, etc.)
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Customer Profile
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Login as a customer
3. Navigate to Home screen
4. Tap the Profile icon in BottomNavigation
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Figma-designed profile screen loads
   - ✅ User email displays correctly
   - ✅ All menu items are clickable
   - ✅ "Order History" navigates to orders screen
   - ✅ "Log Out" shows confirmation dialog
   - ✅ Back button returns to home

### Store Owner Profile
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Login as a store owner
3. Navigate to Home screen
4. Tap the Profile tab
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Profile screen loads with settings menu
   - ✅ Store logo displays (if uploaded)
   - ✅ "Store Product" navigates correctly
   - ✅ All menu items are clickable

## 📝 TODO Comments Added

Several placeholder menu items in customer profile have TODO comments for future implementation:

```typescript
// TODO: Navigate to account settings screen
// router.push('/(main)/(customer)/account-settings');

// TODO: Navigate to e-wallet screen
// router.push('/(main)/(customer)/e-wallet');

// TODO: Navigate to help screen
// router.push('/(main)/(customer)/help');

// TODO: Navigate to terms and privacy screen
// router.push('/(main)/(customer)/terms-privacy');

// TODO: Navigate to notifications screen
// router.push('/(main)/(customer)/notifications');
```

---

## 🗑️ Cleanup Recommendation

The old shared profile can now be safely removed or kept as backup:

**Option 1: Delete (Recommended)**
```bash
rm app/(main)/shared/profile.tsx
```

**Option 2: Rename as Backup**
```bash
mv app/(main)/shared/profile.tsx app/(main)/shared/profile.tsx.backup
```

The `shared/` folder should now only contain truly shared screens like `product-details.tsx`.
